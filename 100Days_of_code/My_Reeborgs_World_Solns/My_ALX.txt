What is real and what is simply a perception or interpretation of the mind?
Is the reality that we experience a shared one, or is it subjective and unique
to each individual? Do our beliefs and perceptions shape our reality, or is
there an objective reality that exists independently of our perceptions? 
These are just a few of the questions you could consider when pondering the
nature of reality.

Taking some time to reflect on these kinds of questions can be a deep and 
thought-provoking exercise that can help you gain a deeper understanding of
yourself, the world round you, and the nature of existence.
